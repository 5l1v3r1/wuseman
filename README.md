Unleashing Bash Mastery: [Nr1 with Double the Power of Nr2! ⚡️](https://wakatime.com/leaders/language/bash)

***

## To all my lost followers, 

I want to address an unfortunate incident that occurred recently. Regrettably, I lost all my followers and previous commits. However, I want to assure you that I am back and determined to continue my work. Although some of my repositories may have been transferred to other users, I have managed to regain control of most of them. Unfortunately, I couldn't recover my followers.

I have been in extensive communication with GitHub, but there is limited recourse available to resolve this situation. If there are any missing elements from my previous profile before it was reset, you may find them on the Wayback Machine.

For those of you who were following me before, I apologize if you are no longer receiving updates. I kindly request that you refollow me to overcome this issue. Rest assured, I am as active as ever, as evident from my commits. So stay tuned for more exciting updates, and let's continue our hacking journey together!

Here are some additional details and links:

- Wayback Machine: You can access my latest cached profile at [github.com/wueman](https://web.archive.org/web/20230324173042/https://github.com/wuseman/)

Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about it. In the meantime, I am investing significant effort into my website and new blog. Feel free to explore them at [https://www.nr1.nu](https://www.nr1.nu) and [https://nr1.nu/blog](https://nr1.nu/blog). Furthermore, I am actively contributing to the Gentoo wiki, which you can find at [wiki.gentoo.org](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Wuseman) if you are interested in my recent engagements that is public.


Thank you for your understanding and continuous support.

Best regards,
